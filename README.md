## Hi there 👋 I'm Mele ##

**A natural problem-solver, I'm most happy when adding value, gaining new knowledge and insights, and helping people get the best out of themselves**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app that helps climbers find a belay partner (i.e. tinder for climber- ish)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **everything**. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on climbing or diversity in tech related projects.
